     <!-- Qs3.Is video tag a semantic tag ? -->
     <!-- the <video> tag does not provide any semantic meaning about the content it contains. 
     It simply specifies that the content is a video, without indicating the purpose or context of
     the video within the document.Therefore, while the <video> tag is useful for embedding video content, 
     it does not contribute to the semantic structure of the web page. -->
