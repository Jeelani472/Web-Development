# Web Development Journey Repository

## 📌 Overview
This repository is a collection of code snippets, projects, and experiments from my **Web Development Journey**. It covers various topics from **frontend to backend**, including database management, server-side logic, and client-side UI development.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
This repository includes projects using the following technologies:

### **Frontend**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS / Bootstrap

### **Backend**
- Node.js & Express.js
- Mongoose & MongoDB
- RESTful APIs
- Authentication & Authorization

### **Database**
- MongoDB
- Mongoose (ODM for MongoDB)

## 📂 Project Structure
The repository contains multiple folders and files categorized by topic:

```
